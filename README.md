The decision to release the code behind my discordbot was not easy to do. By releasing it I will be effectively ending my community, ending my role in my little community, and we're all okay with it. It's best it spreads rather than fizzle out.<br>
<br>
RAH is a discord bot that's designed to help RUST SERVER ADMINS pull up the full image of a player and will help them determine if the player is a hacker or not. Using a combination of shared data from battlemetrics, a resource known as cheetos and any linked discord accounts you have to your profile, a full profile is displayed that'd help admins determine if someones a hacker or not.
<br><br>
CHEETOS - It checks discords servers and logs any discord account that joins both a regular rust server while being in a known cheater discord. This is usually paired up with that servers "AUTH" system or "LINK" system where you have to link your discord account to a steam account. So to avoid detection just don't link a discord account that's used to get cheats.
<br><br>
A similar more popular resource is known as "RAID", inferior in its design and amount of information shared, but superior in the amount of information it has. RAID is one of the resources out there.
<br><br>
What makes any of these resources powerful is their shared data. So if you're a server owner, big or small and have any data shared to you, you can use my discordbot effectively. The more data you have shared with you the better.
<br><br>
These resources are also what people like Camomo use, they take a discord bot like RAH or RAID, check their profile and determine if they're hackers. They also put notes down, maybe staff DM them potential hackers. They might even use the websocket and make alerts when someone joins a server. I can't say for sure their exact process, I just know what I'd do if I wanted to be fully efficient.
<br><br>
RAH was also my reasoning for creating my battlemetrics API wrapper, I needed to efficiently use the API, so I ended up creating my battlemetrics wrapper. Linked here

Throughout my journey I always strived to better the community, to reduce toxicity, however the admin community is so toxic it makes Chernobyl seem tame in comparison. I even reached a point where I was a community contributor in the official battlemetrics discord server. I only ever wanted to help and improve the community.
<br><br>
I want those who supported me to know I'll forever be grateful for their support.
<br><br>
Here's my github repo, for everybody to browse. I don't care if you have issue with my code. It's a bot that has helped hundreds of people and banned thousands of players.

If you have any questions or comments, feel free to ask, literally ANYTHING at all, I will freely answer as long as I know the answer. It's time we discussed the admin side of things.
